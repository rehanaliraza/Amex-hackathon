# AMEX Competition Improvement Strategy

## 🎯 Current Problem Analysis

### Issue Identified
- **Current Score**: 0.2 (very low)
- **Root Cause**: We're submitting binary predictions (0/1) instead of probability scores
- **Expected Format**: Probability scores between 0.0 and 1.0 for AUC evaluation

### Why Binary Predictions Fail
1. **AUC Metric**: Requires probability scores, not binary classifications
2. **Competition Standard**: Most ML competitions expect probabilities
3. **Evaluation Method**: Binary predictions don't allow for ranking/ordering

## 🚀 Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Prediction Format (Immediate)
1. **Use Probability Predictions**: `model.predict_proba()[:, 1]` instead of `model.predict()`
2. **Calibrate Probabilities**: Ensure probabilities are well-calibrated
3. **Test Different Thresholds**: Find optimal probability threshold

### Phase 2: Model Architecture Improvements
1. **Deeper Neural Network**: Increase layers and neurons
2. **Regularization**: Add dropout, L2 regularization
3. **Learning Rate**: Optimize learning rate schedule
4. **Batch Size**: Experiment with different batch sizes

### Phase 3: Feature Engineering
1. **Use All Features**: Don't limit to top 100, use all available features
2. **Feature Interactions**: Create interaction features
3. **Aggregation Features**: Add statistical aggregations
4. **Time-based Features**: Extract date/time patterns from id5

### Phase 4: Advanced Techniques
1. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models
2. **Cross-Validation**: Use proper CV instead of single train/val split
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search or Bayesian optimization
4. **Advanced Balancing**: Try ADASYN, BorderlineSMOTE

### Phase 5: Data Utilization
1. **Full Dataset**: Train on entire dataset, not just 50K samples
2. **Additional Data**: Use add_trans.parquet and add_event.parquet
3. **Data Augmentation**: Create synthetic samples

## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Improvement | Expected Score Gain | Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Probability Predictions | +0.3-0.4 | 🔴 Critical |

| Better Architecture | +0.1-0.15 | 🟡 High |
| Feature Engineering | +0.05-0.1 | 🟢 Medium |
| Ensemble Methods | +0.05-0.1 | 🟢 Medium |

## 🎯 Target Score: 0.6+

### Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate Fix**: Switch to probability predictions
2. **Week 1**: Implement full dataset training
3. **Week 2**: Optimize model architecture
4. **Week 3**: Advanced feature engineering
5. **Week 4**: Ensemble methods and final tuning

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Probability Prediction Fix
```python
# Instead of:
predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Use:
predictions = model.predict_proba(X_test_scaled)[:, 1]
```

### Full Dataset Training
- Use all 770K training samples
- Implement proper memory management
- Use batch processing if needed

### Advanced Model Architecture
```python
MLPClassifier(
    hidden_layer_sizes=(512, 256, 128, 64),
    activation='relu',
    solver='adam',
    alpha=0.0001,  # L2 regularization
    dropout=0.2,   # Dropout regularization
    batch_size=64,
    learning_rate='adaptive',
    max_iter=500,
    early_stopping=True
)
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Target Score**: 0.6+
- **Current Score**: 0.2
- **Required Improvement**: +0.4 points
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

## 🚨 Critical Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix probability predictions
2. **This Week**: Train on full dataset
3. **Next Week**: Implement advanced architecture
4. **Following Week**: Feature engineering and ensemble

This strategy should get us from 0.2 to 0.6+ score!
